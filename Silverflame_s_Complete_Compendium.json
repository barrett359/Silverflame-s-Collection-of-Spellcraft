				"You create 10 semi-tangible, visible magical orbs (called “eyes”) These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they’re small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Tiny construct, about three inches in diameter, that has 1 hit point, AC 18, flies at a speed of 30 feet, and has a +12  Dexterity (Stealth) modifier. It has a Wisdom (Perception) of +8 and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch, and can squeeze through gaps as narrow as 1 inch.",
				"When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well, so if you know, for example, what a typical merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. ",
				"A sample command: “Surround me at a range of four hundred feet and return if you spot any dangerous creatures.” The phrase “Surround me” directs the eyes to form an equally spaced, horizontal ring at whatever range you indicate, and then move with you. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. In the case of this sample command, an eye returns only if it spots a creature you would regard as dangerous. A “peasant” that is actually a shape changed dragon wouldn’t trigger an eye’s return. Ten eyes can form a ring with a radius of 400 feet and between them-selves see everything that crosses the ring. ",
				"Another sample command: “Spread out and search the town for Arweth. Follow him for three minutes, staying out of sight, and then return.” The phrase “Spread out” directs the eyes to move away from you in all directions. In this case, each eye would separately follow Arweth for three minutes once it spots him. ",
				"Other commands that might be useful include having eyes form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or having them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of your directions. ",
				"In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears. If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won’t know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event. The eyes exist for up to 8 hours or until they return to you. Dispel magic can destroy the eyes."

When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed within the target area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Thus, you could specify the illusion of yourself and another character playing chess for the duration of the spell, but you could not have the illusory chess players take a break, make dinner, and then resume their game. You could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area. You could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that your troops be undetected, or even that every fifth person or unit should be visible. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. ",

A band of people standing in a meadow could be  concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, for instance. Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion."
